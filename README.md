## Green Software Engineering examples :seedling:

On this repository, you can find the best practices and recommendations for building a sustainable software


The primary reason we are practicing Green Software Engineering is for sustainability, we develop applications that are carbon efficient by reducing the amount of data and distance it must travel across the network and increase our compute utilization.

During this Lab, we will use terraform to manage our infrastructure as code and to perform software delivery more efficiently.
